Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (
METHODS: Fourteen participants receiving modulator therapy were randomized to receive either KME (n = 9) or placebo control (PC, n = 5) for 5-7 days during hospitalization for treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation or as outpatients under standard care.
RESULTS: The KME was well tolerated, with only mild reports of gastrointestinal distress. D-βHB concentrations increased from 0.2 ± 0.1 mM to 1.6 ± 0.6 mM in the KME 
group compared to 0.2 ± 0.0 to 0.3 ± 0.1 in the PC group (
CONCLUSIONS: With the emerging role of exogenous ketones as nutrient signaling molecules and mediators of metabolism, we showed that KME is well tolerated, increases 
circulating D-βHB concentrations, and produces outcomes that justify the need for large-scale clinical trials to investigate the role of KME on whole-body and tissue 
lipid accumulation and inflammation in pwCF.
